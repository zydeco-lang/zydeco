## Project Tracker

1. Identify the features that we want
   - polymorphic monad instance
   - user controlled lifting (reinterpret)
   - term and type reusing (import) (theory-side upgrade needed)
   - using terms within monadic block in their lifted form (unquote)
2. come up with a "usable" version of syntax accordingly
3. examples
   - error handling with non-trivial algebra
   - transformers for free
4. type checking
5. lifting
