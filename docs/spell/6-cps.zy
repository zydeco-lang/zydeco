-- # Chapter 6: Continuation Passing Style

-- Peek the wikipedia article on [Continuation Passing Style]
-- (http:--en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style) if you haven't
-- already. Any arbitrary example in it would be sufficient to demonstrate the
-- idea.

-- If you have closely inspected any test bench, you'll immediately notice how
-- we adopt CPS in the design of `OS` type.

def xs : List String =
  +Cons("1", +Cons("2", +Cons("3", +Cons("not only you and me", +Nil()))))
end

-- Exercise: Choose one of the following tasks (or both):
-- 1. Reverse a list.
-- 2. Print a list.

main
  ! exit 0
end

-- Hint: If you don't know how to print something, see `write_str` and `write_line`.
