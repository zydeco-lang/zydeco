# Arena Reclamation Worklog

Companion to [docs/ideas/arena-gc.md](../ideas/arena-gc.md), which holds the design and
the classification tables. This log records attempts, observations, measurements, and
decisions while implementing the plan.

## Background Measurements (before this log)

- One fresh std check (`std/std.zy`, 65K scoped terms) materializes 2.06M `types_pre`
  nodes: 46% `App`, 25% `Arrow`, 13% `Label`, 11% `Prod`; 69.8% of node contents are
  unique, so value hash-consing is not worth an interning layer.
- Peak RSS for that check: 7.5GB initially; 2.42GB after the phase merge (`5b6f79cd`),
  table pre-reservation (`c485a16b`), and the normalized delta (`2680cb7d`).
- A long-lived session retains every root's arena: the test suite's shared session
  reached ~29GB before `SessionPool` capped it; the editor session has the same shape.
- salsa 0.26 stores everything per database (`Arc<Zalsa>`, freed on drop) and its
  `evict_lru` only resets revisions — no per-query eviction exists.

## 2026-08-15 — round 1: salsa LRU on the check memo, then the L/S split

### Findings

- salsa 0.26 supports `lru = <usize>` per tracked function (via the `Lru`
  eviction policy); eviction fires in `reset_for_new_revision`, reachable without an
  input write through `Database::trigger_lru_eviction`. Creating new salsa inputs does
  *not* bump the revision, so multi-root sessions must trigger eviction explicitly.
- `lru = 1` on `check_source` plus a per-analyze trigger dropped the session suite peak
  from 18.0GB to 9.93GB; raising the pool cap to 64 grew it to 16.3GB, i.e. per-root
  judgment memos cost ~115MB and still need the pool cap. The entry-counted LRU cannot
  express root-scoped eviction for the fine-grained judgment queries (one root has
  millions of entries per query), so the pool generation remains their policy.
- A plain re-derivation of the pipeline does *not* hit the check memo: `ScopedData::new`
  creates a fresh tracked identity every call. Sharing the memo requires a tracked
  `resolved_data(db, root)` query so every consumer of one root holds the same
  `ScopedData` and therefore the same `check_source` memo entry.

### Changes

- `check_source` memoizes with `lru = 1`; the test pool triggers eviction per analysis.
- `StaticsArena::strip_occurrence_payload` clears the occurrence payload
  (`types_pre`/`kinds_pre`/`values`/`compus`/patterns/annotations/normalized) and keeps
  the keyed indexes.
- `analyze_source` strips before constructing `ProgramAnalysis`; the analysis now
  retains only the L tier. `CompilerSession::materialize_arena` / `checked_program` /
  `executable_program` re-materialize on demand from the memoized check; the three
  S-reading fact queries (`normalized_type_at`, `coverage_facts`,
  `term_annotation_at`) re-derive through `rechecked`.
- Consumers migrated: the CLI, the REPL engine, cajun, and the integration tests now
  obtain the typed arena from the session. cajun's `ProjectState` materializes once at
  load and holds the arena for the project's lifetime — the project is a live consumer
  of its root, which the design permits.

### Measurements

- Session suite (2 threads): 149 passed; peak RSS 9.93GB after the LRU step, 6.32GB
  after the L/S split; 72s wall. Full workspace suite: 739 passed, 0 failed.

### Known Costs / Next

- The three S-reading fact queries clone the whole arena per new key (hover pays a
  transient ~500MB clone). The permanent fix is per-fact judgment replay; until then
  hover stays correct but heavyweight.
- `lru = 1` means materializing a stale (non-latest) analysis re-checks its root;
  acceptable while consumers hold their own materialized copy.
- Next candidates: per-fact replay for hover, root-scoped policy for judgment memos
  (the pool cap is the current answer), and quantifying the retained L tier per root.
