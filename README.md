# Zydeco ðŸª—

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14948044.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14948044)

Zydeco is a proof-of-concept programming language based on Call-by-push-value.

## Running Zydeco

Create a file `hello-world.zydeco`:
```plain
main
  ! write_line "hello, world!"
  { ! exit 0 }
end
```

Then run
```bash
$ cargo run -- run hello-world.zydeco
hello, world!
```

Alternatively, run
```bash
cargo build --release
```
to build the executable which will be stored at `target/release/zydeco`.

Then run
```bash
./target/release/zydeco run hello-world.zydeco
```
and see
```console
hello, world!
```

Run `zydeco --help` for further usage information.

## Intro to Zydeco

We now have a toy "literate zydeco" written in zydeco! Try it out by running
```bash
cd docs/spell && make build
```
and the product will show up right in the folder - which is also a series of guide to programming in zydeco.
Maybe we should call it "co-literate zydeco" because it turns commented zydeco into markdown.

A legacy version of the tutorial lies [here](docs/tutorial/intro_to_zydeco.md).
You might find the short tutorial easier to follow if the previous `spell` guide goes too fast.

We will develop more introductory material on zydeco when we have
implemented more features. For now, you can also choose to browse `lib/` for
some example programs.

To run all tests
```bash
cargo test --all
```

interpreter for the Zydeco language.
- `lib/`: standard library and example code (also serving as test cases)
- `cli/` Command-line interface
- `web/` Web interface
